leaks the dev subdomain

I checked what happens if you view a page that doesnt exist, you get a specific error - upon which if you google this error you find that it's specific to Joomla.

Found a reference to a Joomla scanner online, and figured I would try it.  The scanner mentioned that this version is out of date - googling for vulnerabilites lists a few, but the below seems the most useful:
https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2023-23752/

Exploit on GH does exist, running that gives us an error though.  As I was going through the code, it looks like it just requests a specific page (lol), accessing this page does give us some information, notably some credentials:

lewis
P4ntherg0t1n5r3c0n##

However these^ are not for SSH, so lets try something else.  I ran a gobuster on the dev subdomain, and did notice that an enpoint exists of /administrator, which asks for creds - thanks to lewis we have access.

Greeted by a notification that "We have detected that your server is using PHP 7.4.3" -> not sure that this will have any effect here though.

It is indeed not needed, there is a templates section that has a bunch of PHP files.  Similar to a lot of the THM boxes, you just replace one (easiest is prob the error page) with a php reverse shell, then you can request anything that will fail to get a shell.

Afterwords, I couldnt really find anything as the user we have, but there is a db server running, and I was able to login with the creds from earlier - dumping the user table:

649 | lewis      | lewis    | lewis@devvortex.htb | $2y$10$6V52x.SD8Xc7hNlVwUTrI.ax4BIAYuhVBMVvnYWRceBmy8XdEzm1u 
650 | logan paul | logan    | logan@devvortex.htb | $2y$10$IT4k5kmSGvHSO9d6M/1w0eYiB5Ne9XzArQRFJTGThNiy/yBtkIj12 

I'm just going to focuse on logan, considering they have the /home dir.  This does indeed crack, and gives us the user flag :)
------------------------------------
I forgot to write the pass down after I cracked it (coming back to this after a break), and I couldn't rerun john against it, I guess it saves hashes - something like that at least?  Just run the below command for future reference:
john hash --show

(tequieromucho)

Basic enum with sudo -l shows that you can run apport-cli, I didnt find anything on gtfo bins, but just googling for a vulnerability in this cmdlet did return some results.  I actually came across this article as a PoC, but didnt realize until the end that it's literally for this HTB box...  But, oh well I guess...
