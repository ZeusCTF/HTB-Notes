looks like for root you need to port forward port 5555 then connect via adb?
-------------------

So, what you need to do is port forward port 5555 from the android VM, to our machine:
ssh -p 2222 -L 5555:localhost:5555 kristi@10.10.10.247

*******
For example, say you wanted to connect from your laptop to http://www.ubuntuforums.org using an SSH tunnel. You would use source port number 8080 (the alternate http port), destination port 80 (the http port), and destination server www.ubuntuforums.org. :

ssh -L 8080:www.ubuntuforums.org:80 <host>

Where <host> should be replaced by the name of your laptop. The -L option specifies local port forwarding. For the duration of the SSH session, pointing your browser at http://localhost:8080/ would send you to http://www.ubuntuforums.org/. 
********

I think the idea is that we connect via ssh, then are able to port forward?

Anyways, after this step is done, you connect via the forwarded port (using adb):
adb connect localhost:5555

Then you litterally just type:
adb shell
su
cd data && ls
cat root.txt

No idea why you can just su to root on Android, seems pretty shit tbh....
