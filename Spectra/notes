ip = 10.10.10.229

If you click the testing link, you get sent to a database error page.  Navigating one dir up, you see a bunch of files, the wp-config.php.save has:

The name of the database for WordPress */
define( 'DB_NAME', 'dev' );

/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'devtest' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'devteam01' )

we can login to the main wp-admin prompt using the administrator acc (found on the normal page) and the pass shown here.

(my ip = 10.10.15.29)

users:
administrator
users on box:
chronos
