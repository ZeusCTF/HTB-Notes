 just the one port is open from the init scan:
 
 PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://shibboleth.htb/
Service Info: Host: shibboleth.htb

It looks like on the site there is a contact portion where you can enter an email and a POST request is made with that info, I doubt this is anything tho

gobuster did find a /forms/ dir, that had this readme:

Fully working PHP/AJAX contact form script is available in the pro version of the template.
You can buy it from: https://bootstrapmade.com/flexstart-bootstrap-startup-template/

there was also a 'contact.php' file, with interestingly an error occuring 'unable to load the php email from library"  -> this is odd b/c the site uses html (found from indexing, although I could be wrong)

From some "hints" on the fourms I ran a full tcp port scan and got nothing, as well as a udp port scan which got this:

Not shown: 999 closed udp ports (port-unreach)
PORT    STATE SERVICE
623/udp open  asf-rmcp

just some quick googling of this port led to this:

"""
the IPMI 2.0 specification, namely that cipher type 0, an indicator that the client wants to use clear-text authentication, actually allows access with any password. Cipher 0 issues were identified in HP, Dell, and Supermicro BMCs, with the issue likely encompassing all IPMI 2.0 implementations.
Note that to exploit this issue you first need to find a valid user.
You can identify this issue using
