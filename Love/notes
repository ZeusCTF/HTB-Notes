IP = 10.10.10.239

ssl cert mentions: staging.love.htb

looks like the images directory contains some shells - probably need to upload something there

the staging host has a beta.php page, where you are able to upload files to scan, not sure where they go...

looks like these files print their output to the screen, ie the webpage renders the file???

just had to point this at the sql port....

admin | @LoveIsInTheAir!!!! 
_______________

this login let us access the admin page, which has an account creation thing with an image assocaited with every profile....  Using the basic shell here, I was able to run the profile.exe file that was uploaded seperately.  While using msfconsole, this got me a shell on the box.
(FYI i used mulit/handler (exploit) to catch the shell)

to get system, a guide used:

exploit/windows/local/always_install_elevated                   2010-03-18       excellent  Yes    Windows AlwaysInstallElevated MSI

within MSF, need to update this later with why/what this does
