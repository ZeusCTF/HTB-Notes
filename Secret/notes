The nmap scan makes it look like there are two http services running, but the 3000 port is hosting Node.js, some kind of API perhaps?: 3000/tcp open  http    Node.js (Express middleware)

This is on the intro of the port 80 site: This is a API based Authentication system. we are using JWT tokens to make things more secure. to store the user data we are using mongodb, you can find a demo of how the api works in here this is a very secured Authentication system will well done documentation ( sometimes companies hide endpoints ) but our code is public 


To register a user it lookes like you make a post reuqest to the 3000 site under /api/user/register with JSON containing user info

If you copy the data on the website, and add the Content-Type line indicating the information is JSON (like the below)

Content-Type: application/json


  {
	"name": "dasith",
	"email": "root@dasith.works",
	"password": "Kekc8swFgD6zU"
  }
You get an error that the email already exists.

This request:
  {
	"name": "HalJor",
	"email": "green@lantern.com",
	"password": "password"
  }
got this output:

I guess I missed that the source is on  the site, after downloading it, looks like the /local-web/routes/forgot.js
has a section that checks if the name is set to: theadmin


So there's a .env file with this:
cat .env                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1 âš™
DB_CONNECT = 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/auth-web'
TOKEN_SECRET = secret

looks like there is a .git - should probably investigate that more..


so based on the comments, i need to forge a token and authenticate to the api.  That being said, they also mention
that the secret above is most likely changed, which i guess makes sense.  I found this within the master file:
e297a2797a5f62b6011654cf6fb6ccb6712d2d5b
this could be the secret

after learning some, you need to go into the .git dir and run the git show cmd, then you can find that there is a commit to remove the acutal secret, which is:

I'm very confused as to what steps I need to take, so for example I read the private.js file and found this page /api/logs that takes a param like so

GET /api/logs?file= HTTP/1.1

but you seemingly get this as output when providing nothing

"80bf34c fixed typos ðŸŽ‰\n0c75212 now we can view logs from server ðŸ˜ƒ\nab3e953 Added the codes\n"

GET /api/logs?file=;cat+/home/dasith/user.txt

this got the flag ^

next step would be to figure out how to get the rev shell
