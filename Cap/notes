/capture intercepted redirect shows it's a guicorn server

FTP:

USER nathan
PASS Buck3tH4TF0RM3!

maybe the cap discussion has something:
https://forum.hackthebox.eu/discussion/4764/official-cap-discussion

it looks like you can move upwards through the directory structure but I cant find anything.

If you look at 0.pcap, it looks like there is some way to upload files but I dont understand how to make it work....

btw, you can use ftp via a webbrowser which may be easier

The privesc is with Linux Capbilities, gtfobins has this python code:
python3 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/sh")'
that I used to gain root, however hacktricks has a more detailied article that might be better:
