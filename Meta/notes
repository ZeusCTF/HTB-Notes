(full tcp port scan = nothing new)

Only two ports open, so my initial reaction is to start a full port scan, as well as a UDP port scan.  Also, we can note that the hostname is leaked here, so adding this to the hosts file.

The site itself lists three users:
Judy E
Sara W
Thomas S -> of note, this guy is a PHP dev.

Oddly, I assumed that the site would have an index.php file, but it turns out only to have index.html.  Regardless, I will still scan for both extensions using gobuster.  Possible useful info, the site mentions a product in "testing" so that may be related to a subdomain used for testing resources -> just a thought.

The gobuster dir scan didn't return much, just a bunch of 403s and a couple 301s but when visting the directories I was hit with a 404...

The gobuster vhost scan DID return something.  Just as I originally thought, there appears to be a development sub-domain: Found: dev01.artcorp.htb (Status: 200) [Size: 247] which hosts this "new" app.  I added this to my hosts file and navigated to the metaview dir.  Funny enough, I downloaded exiftool to extract some info from the images on the original site, and the output is almost the same (if not the same) as the output I get when using the metaview tool.

pretty sure this stuff should work:

https://github.com/AssassinUKG/CVE-2021-22204

But the site is giving me a "no data was found" or some bullshit even for vaild images...
Actually it does work, but you need to use an image from the site itself.  testpic.jpg works, so just use that + confile to replace the configfile, and update the payload to a rev shell.

Just use the exploit.py file to generate the payload correctly, you will probably have to update the IP + image but that's easy.  Per some of the fourm notes, you need to check out the processes running on the box, which you can see below some interesting ones I found after runnin pspy

Next stop, investigating these:
