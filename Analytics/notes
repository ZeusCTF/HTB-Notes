added analytical.htb to the hosts file.  The site has some email address listed:

demo@analytical.com
due@analytical.com


The "login" tab redirects to a "data" subdomain.  http://data.analytical.htb/auth/forgot_password exists, but an admin has to reset the password.  The site appears to be running the Metabase CMS software? https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/configuring-metabase/settings

Just googling for vulnerabilities turns up this link: https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2023-38646/, with this PoC: https://github.com/kh4sh3i/CVE-2023-38646.  The PoC at the GH link says that you can test if a site is vulnerable by going to this link: http://data.analytical.htb/api/session/properties, which does give some output, so I assume the vuln is applicable?


That script didnt work for me, you need burp collaborator and I wasn't able to adjust it to get any output (didn't appear to be connecting...?)  Anyways, this script DID work "https://github.com/securezeron/CVE-2023-38646/blob/main/CVE-2023-38646-Reverse-Shell.py" however I just took the post_setup_validate function from the main file and adjusted it for my purposes and that worked for me to get a rev shell.

After using the exploit, you get a shell on the box.  Some basic enumeration later, (running the env command) outputs:

META_USER=metalytics
META_PASS=An4lytics_ds20223#

which is an SSH user for the machine.  User.txt obtained.
