The ip given redirects to http://horizontall.htb/, so this had to be mapped within the hosts file

Note from creator:
Foothold: When you found that hidden web interface , you better not rush and use All CVE your found on google , first find the VERSION of that dashboard than chain your attack So you can get a Foothold on the machine.

Found this in the source:
http://api-prod.horizontall.htb/reviews

Nikto found a /admin dir on this sub-domian ^

Google-Fu to get a strapi expliot which created an account for me


I think two exploits are needed, something about the json portion isnt making sense, perhaps the first exploit is used to get the jwt token, then this: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50238 is used for RCE?

---------------------
I guess you just need to use the first exploit to request a reverse shell from your machine and pipe it to bash.  I had tried sending these requests to burp to intercept the request thinking that there was something wrong with the request being made but no, I am just going down a rabbit hole.
