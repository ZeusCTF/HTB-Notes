Navigating to the site, I'm prompted with a page asking for an email/pass to login.  Wappalyzer is indicating this is a Laravel site, with Nginx running on Ubuntu.  There is a password reset link which may be useful in the future.  Also worth noting, an Admin subdomain is referenced, I'll try brute-forcing others now.

Registering an account doesn't appear to lead to anything interesting, just a page for a blog, but it's just a static page.  Default admin/admin creds for laravel dont work either.  The subdomain brute force didnt result in any additional domains being leaked, however, I may try another list.  

a Gobuster on the admin subdomain didn't really find any additional pages, aside from these two:
/uploads              (Status: 301) [Size: 178] [--> http://admin.usage.htb/uploads/]                                                                 
/admin                (Status: 302) [Size: 402] [--> http://admin.usage.htb/admin/auth/login]
